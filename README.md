🥑 Avocado Ripeness Dashboard | Power BI + Data Science
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze the ripeness of avocados using real-world physical parameters such as firmness, brightness, sound levels, color indicators, and more.

It builds on earlier Python-based machine learning analysis and transforms those insights into a user-friendly, visual decision-making tool for stakeholders.

📊 Dashboard Features
✅ Interactive visuals to explore avocado ripeness stages

✅ Data modeling to represent measurable physical attributes

✅ Dynamic charts:

Bar charts

Scatter plots

Pie charts

Correlation heatmaps

✅ Slicers and filters for real-time exploration by users

🎯 Objective
To help stakeholders in agriculture, food retail, and supply chain management gain actionable insights into avocado ripeness prediction. This supports inventory planning, quality control, and logistics decisions.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool/Library	Purpose
Power BI	Dashboard design, data modeling, DAX
Python	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
pandas	Data wrangling and preprocessing
seaborn	Visualization during EDA
ML Model	Trained in Python, insights integrated into the dashboard

🧠 Related Work
This dashboard builds on my previous Avocado Ripeness ML Project where I trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict ripeness stages using Python.

✅ Outcome
Non-technical users can now interactively explore and understand ripeness stages

Bridges the gap between data science and business intelligence

Provides a decision-support system for real-world agri-tech applications
